#Typer


Touch typing web app which allows you to paste in your own text.

Typer utilizes AngularJS and Nodewebkit to have the option to see a web app or standalone app.

##Standalone App
After installing everything type:
```
grunt dist-mac --force
```
This will create a /dist folder which will hold the app.

##Web App
You will need to move index.html to root and refactor it's dependencies.
Otherwise check out an old version which does not use AngularJS [here](http://typer.com.au).

###Contributions are welcome!
